Hi, I'm Sebastian, a UX Designer that likes to code. I born in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I have 8+ years of experience on Digital Products and I've worked on several projects from different industries: B2B, B2C, Non Profit Orgs, Volunteer.

I like to start new endeavors.

I love to discover, learn and understand problems to find the simpler solutions.

Because of the type of clients I primarily work with, I’m not able to display some of the work I did. If you would like to see some examples or something a bit more specific, please get in touch and I’d be happy to send you some examples! Usually, you can find me hanging out on Twitter both in Spanish and English. I would love to hear you!

> I worked with Sebastian and depended on him to provide UX designs and workflows to ensure proposed features would both work within the existing product UI and enhance the experience of our users. Sebastian always provided clear designs and typically provide alternate designs in order to present the best possible options.
